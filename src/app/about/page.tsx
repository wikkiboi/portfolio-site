          I grew up in the{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area">
            San Francisco Bay Area
          </a>{" "}
          my whole life. I&apos;ve moved to 5 different cities in the area,
          including San Jose. The internet in the 2010s made it easy to keep in
          touch with friends, so naturally, I spent a good chunk of time on it
          and my computer
        </p>
        <p>
          In middle school, I got into competitive swimming. I won a few medals
          for my local swim team and got pretty obssessed with improving my
          times. It always felt great seeing my numbers get better over time.
          Similarly, I fell into the massive rabbit hole that is{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu!">osu!</a>, a rhythm game I
          poured thousands of hours getting good at and hit a peak rank of top
          2,000 global.
        </p>
        <p>
          I attended{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Riverside">
            Univeristy of California Riverside
          </a>{" "}
          initially with an undeclared major. I decided on Statistics as my
          major since I was interested in the problem solving aspect of it. I
          learned how to work with datasets, analyze them using statistical
          methods, and how to interpret and present findings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prerequisites for the upper-division courses called for a few
          Computer Science courses, which prompted my first contact with the
          programming world.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first ever programming course had me learn{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>, where we
          covered the basic syntax and patterns found in programming languages,
          like variables, functions, operators, loops, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got hooked on making functional software and decided to pursue a
          Computer Science minor. But there&apos;s only so much hands-on
          programming to do in these courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was looking up different outlets for creating software and came
          across <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp&apos;s</a>{" "}
          Responsive Web Design course. I ended up diving deep into the
          Frontend, starting with HTML & CSS, then JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also went through{" "}
          <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a> and
          their Full Stack JavaScript curriculum, where I picked up React, SQL,
          Node.js/Express, and more specifics about web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going through their lessons and smaller projects were great learning
          experiences, but the most learning I&apos;ve done is through my own
          projects. I&apos;ve built these projects over the past year or so,
          such as <a href="https://zenbu.netlify.app">zenbu</a> and{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/wikkiboi/talkify-app">Talkify</a>, which
          the latter I did in collaboration with 3 other developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating clean, accessible websites became my newfound passion. I
          always hold the mindset that these programs are meant to be used by
          others, which sounds obvious, but there are too many sites I&apos;ve
          come across that seem to try and make it as unintuitive as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, I&apos;m studying up on{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)">
            Golang
          </a>{" "}
          since I&apos;ve heard many great things about it. I&apos;ve also been
          learning more about Docker and its use cases. I&apos;m planning on
          implementing both in a new project that might be showcased here in the
          near future, so stay tuned.
