      <article>
        <p>
          I grew up in the{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area">
            San Francisco Bay Area
          </a>{" "}
          my whole life. I&apos;ve moved to 5 different cities in the area,
          including San Jose. Even with the constant moving, the rise of
          internet in the 2010s made it easy to keep in touch with friends, so I
          naturally spent a lot of time on my computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my teenage years, I got into competitive swimming. I won a few
          medals for my local swim team and got pretty obssessed with improving
          my times. There was some degree of pride attached to it, but moreso
          than that, I loved the feeling of control I had when performing at a
          high level â€” like every part of my body moved how I wanted it to. For
          the same reason, I also fell into the massive rabbit hole that is{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu!">osu!</a>, a PC rhythm
          game I poured thousands of hours getting good at and hit a peak rank
          of top 2,000 global.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later on, I studied Statistics at{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Riverside">
            Univeristy of California Riverside
          </a>
          {". "}I learned how to work with datasets, use statistical methods to
          analyze them, and present interpretable findings with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prerequisites for my upper-division courses called for a few
          Computer Science courses, which prompted my first contact with the
          programming world.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first ever programming course covered{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>, where we went
          over the basic syntax and patterns in programming languages, like
          variables, functions, operators, loops, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, I got hooked on making functional software. I realized the
          same drive I had for improving swim times and climbing osu! ranks
          carried over into software. There&apos;s something deeply rewarding
          about refining an app until it feels smooth, intuitive, and enjoyable
          to use. I decided to pursue a Computer Science minor and take more
          related courses, but there was only so much hands-on programming these
          courses had to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I looked into different outlets for creating software and came
          across <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp&apos;s</a>{" "}
          Responsive Web Design course. I ended up diving deep into the
          Frontend, starting with HTML & CSS, then JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also went through{" "}
          <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a> and
          their Full Stack JavaScript curriculum, where I picked up React, SQL,
          Node.js/Express, and more specifics about web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going through their lessons and smaller projects were great learning
          experiences, but the most learning I&apos;ve done is through my own
          projects. I&apos;ve built these projects over the past year or so,
          such as <a href="https://zenbu.netlify.app">zenbu</a> and{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/wikkiboi/talkify-app">Talkify</a>, which
          the latter I did in collaboration with 3 other developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working on projects made me realize how even small design choices can
          make or break a user&apos;s experience. Just like how datasets become
          most useful when presented clearly in Statistics, I believe web apps
          should feel effortless to navigate and accessible to everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, I&apos;m studying up on{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)">
            Golang
          </a>{" "}
          since I&apos;ve heard many great things about it. I&apos;ve also been
          learning more about more DevOps-oriented things like{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)">Docker</a>,
          CI/CD, and cloud services. I&apos;m planning on implementing these in
          a new project that might be showcased here in the near future, so stay
          tuned.
